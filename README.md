# vector.lua
A simple vector library for lua. This was mainly made to practice using metatables.

## Installation
First, download `vector.lua` and add it to your project or whatever.
Then, add this wherever you `require` your libraries:
```lua
require "vector"
```

## Vectors
`vector.lua` is all about vector objects you create using the `vector()` function.
Vectors are tables consisting of a list of values, starting at 1 (one). Creating a vector looks something like this:
```lua
v = Vector(10, 254, 27)
```
This is almost the same as
```lua
v = {10, 254,  27}
```
but there is one key distinction, I'll demonstrate it with this block of code:
```lua
v = Vector(5, -265, 111)
print(v[1]) --> 5
print(v.x)  --> 5

print(v.x == v[1]) --> true

print(v.y) --> -265
```
You can also access values in vectors using letters. specifically x, y, z, and w, in that order, but r, g, b, and a also works the same for reasons I'll get into later.

You can also perform most arithmetic operators on vectors (namely +, -, /, \*, %, ^, and negation).
Example:
```lua
a = Vector(3, 10, -14)
b = Vector(-6, 22, 5)
print(unpack(a - b)) --> 9       -12     -19
```

If there's a size mismatch, then the smaller vector will be rescaled to the bigger vector.
```lua
a = Vector(82, 11, -543)
b = Vector(6, 0)
print(unpack(a + b)) --> 88      11      -537
```

When performing vector arithmetic with a number, the number becomes a size 1 (one) vector.
```lua
v = Vector(3, 5)
print(unpack(v * 2)) --> 6       10
```

## Functions

### Vector(...)
Creates a vector with a size of the length of `...`, with each of the values in the vector corresponding to the argument of the same index.
```lua
v = Vector(644, 213, -186, 320, 123)
```

### Vec1, Vec2, Vec3, and Vec4(...)
Like `Vector` except that it has a set size and any missing values are automatically set to 0.
```lua
v = Vec3(1,2)
print(v.x) --> 0
print(v.y) --> 0
print(v.z) --> 0
```

### Vec(size, ...)
`Vector` but the size is set by the `size` argument.
```lua
v = Vec(100, 5, 8, 123)
print(v.x)   --> 5
print(v[3])  --> 123
print(v[54]) --> 0
```

### VecC(...)
`Vec4` but the default value is 1 instead of 0. Mainly made for [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org)'s colo(u)r values. This is why you can also use r, g, b, and a to access vectors.
```lua
col = VecC(1,0,0)
col.b = 1
love.graphics.setColor(col)
love.graphics.print("Wow! This text is magenta.")
```
